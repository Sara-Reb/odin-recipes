    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These easy chicken fajitas are a classic combination of
      <strong>seasoned chicken strips, onions, and peppers.</strong> The
      <strong>homemade fajita seasoning</strong> adds a punch of not-too-spicy
      flavor, and dinner is ready in about 20 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>Make-Ahead Tips!</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few things you can do ahead to make your weeknight meal a
      little quicker and easier:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Combine the spice mixture up to several days in advance. Cover and store
        the mixture in a cool, dark place until it's time to make the fajitas.
        This spice mix will also keep for several months in a sealed container.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice the bell peppers and onions the day before and store them in a
        covered container in the refrigerator until it's time to cook them.
      </li>
      <li>
        The chicken can also be sliced and stored in a covered container in the
        fridge.
      </li>
    </ul>
