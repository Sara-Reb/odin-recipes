    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Risotto is Italian rice dish with arborio rice as the base, and various
      other vegetables and flavorings incorporated. Arborio rice is a variety of
      short-grain white rice that is named after the region of Italy where it
      was originally cultivated. It is naturally high in starch, which serves an
      important function in creating the distinctive, creamy texture of this
      dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The addition of butternut squash to risotto offers satisfying and playful
      sweet and savory flavors. While most of the squash pieces will maintain
      their texture, some of the squash will naturally break down. The end
      result is a brightly-colored dish that is exceptionally creamy.

        <strong><em>Be Patient</em></strong>

          One key feature of a properly cooked risotto is patience, meaning that
          this is definitely not a dish to make when you are in a hurry or
          impatient. A typical risotto preparation will take at least 45 minutes
          and requires your attention for the duration of the cooking process.
          Cooking risotto is a great counterbalance to our fast-paced world: an
          opportunity to slow down, be mindful, and be in awe of how these tiny
          hard grains are transformed into something so soft, creamy, and
          inviting.

        <strong><em>Use Hot Broth</em></strong>
      </dt>

        <p>
          Risotto is cooked slowly and in stages, with the addition of small
          amounts of hot broth to create the much desired creamy texture. Using
          hot broth expedites the cooking process and allows for the rice to
          cook properly and more efficiently.

        <strong><em>Don't Forget to Stir -- But Not Too Much</em></strong>
      </dt>

        <p>
          It may be hard to believe, but the key technique used to develop the
          signature creamy texture of risotto is the simple stir! Stirring
          allows the rice grains to rub against each other and release some of
          the natural starch back into the dish.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is absolutely necessary to stir frequently, it is equally
          important not to over-stir. Over-stirring could result in too much
          starch being released into the dish, resulting in a porridge-y
          consistency. As a general rule, stirring every 30 seconds allows the
          rice to release the right amount of starch while preventing the rice
          from sticking to the bottom of the pot.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 1/2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 medium butternut squash, about 1 pound</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 large shallots, minced (about 1/2 cup) shallots</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh sage leaves, divided</li>
      <li>1 cup arborio rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><p>Gather the ingredients.</p></li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the broth in a medium saucepan on medium heat until it simmers.
          Reduce the heat to low, cover and continue to simmer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, using a sharp, heavy chef’s knife, cut off both ends of the
          squash. Peel the squash using a vegetable peeler, scoop out the seeds,
          and cut the squash into 1/2 inch cubes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heat the oil in a Dutch oven or other heavy-duty pot on medium heat.
          When the oil shimmers, add the shallots and sauté until translucent
          and aromatic, about 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of minced sage leaves, and diced squash.
          Continue to sauté on medium heat for 6 to 8 more minutes, stirring
          occasionally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the rice, stirring frequently, until the rice is lightly toasted,
          1 to 2 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the wine and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the
          wine is absorbed into the squash and rice mixture, about 3 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and 1/2 cup of the
          vegetable broth, stirring every 30 seconds, until the broth is
          absorbed into the rice. Continue by adding 1/2 cup of broth at a time,
          again stirring every 30 seconds, until the broth has been absorbed.
          This step should take about 45 to 50 minutes, until the squash is soft
          and creamy and the rice cooked through, but still al dente.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove the risotto from the heat, and stir in the butter and Parmesan
          cheese.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Garnish with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of minced sage leaves and
          serve hot.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Recipe Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Wine can be eliminated and replaced by more broth or water.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          While store-bought vegetable or chicken broth is convenient,
          home-prepared broth can add that extra depth to the dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The freshly grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano that is added at the
          very end should be of the best quality, offering a special salty and
          nutty flavor and adding extra creaminess.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Risotto will thicken as it sits, so it is best served immediately
          after preparation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Risotto is highly versatile and can be prepared plain on its own or
          mixed with a medley of other vegetables such as asparagus, sweet
          potatoes, delicata squash, mushrooms, peas, or fava beans.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Explore additional flavorings such as saffron, thyme, rosemary,
          parsley, or lemon zest to liven up the risotto. A handful of lightly
          toasted nuts can also add a special crunch to contrast with the creamy
          risotto. If you are feeling creative, consider topping the dish with
          fried sage leaves or crispy fried shallots.
