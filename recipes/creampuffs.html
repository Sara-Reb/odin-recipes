    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The cream puff was first brought over to France in the 1500s by Italian
      noblewoman Catherine de’ Medici’s pastry chef when she married King Henry
      II. Later perfected in the early 1700s by French pastry chef Antoine
      Carême, the cream puff became a classic in French cuisine and many
      bakeries throughout Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cream puffs are traditionally filled with pastry cream or whipped cream
      while the looser term of profiteroles encompasses other fillings,
      including savory ones. This being said, in America profiteroles as seen on
      menus in restaurants are usually filled with ice cream.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Make the Pastry Cream</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather the ingredients.Prepare an ice bath large enough to hold a medium
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine the milk and 1/4 cup of the sugar in a medium saucepan over
        medium-high heat until the mixture just begins to boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine the egg, egg yolk, the remaining 1/4 cup of
        sugar, cornstarch, vanilla, and salt. Whisk by hand until pale, fluffy,
        and smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the milk-sugar mixture begins to boil, slowly add it to the egg
        mixture in a thin, steady stream while whisking continuously to prevent
        cooking the eggs (this process is called tempering).
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the custard to the saucepan and whisk continuously over
        medium-low heat until it bubbles and thickens, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove
        the pan from the heat and continue to whisk until smooth, another 1 to 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the pastry cream through a fine mesh sieve and into a clean bowl.
        This will remove any coagulated bits of egg.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the surface of the custard directly with plastic wrap to prevent a
        skin from forming. Place the bowl into the prepared ice bath and let
        cool, about 30 minutes. Remove from the ice bath and refrigerate for at
        least 30 minutes more, or until ready to use. While the pastry cream
        cools, make the optional craquelin and the choux.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the Choux</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather the ingredients. Position a rack in the center of the oven and
        heat to 400 F.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan bring the water, butter, salt, and sugar to a boil
        over high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat off, add the flour, and stir until it comes together into
        a ball, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pan to medium-high heat, stirring constantly until the
        mixture begins to look dry, 3 to 4 minutes. There should be a thin film
        of dough at the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the dough to a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix
        the dough on medium speed to cool slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough is cool, add the eggs one at a time until completely
        absorbed before adding the next. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and
        continue to mix until the dough is well combined, smooth, and glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fit a piping bag with a half inch circle tip (such as Ateco tip #805).
        Fill the piping bag with the batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare 2 baking sheets by piping a small dot of batter on each corner,
        then line with parchment paper. This will prevent the parchment paper
        from flying up in the oven when the fan turns on if you are using a
        convection oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pipe 2-inch round mounds of batter, 2-inches apart by holding the pastry
        bag vertically, 1/2-inch away from the paper and gently squeezing
        without moving the piping bag. When you reach the desired size, quickly
        twist and flick the piping bag so you have more of a flat top than a
        peak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the egg wash by whisking together the egg, milk, and salt in a
        small bowl. Brush the tops of the choux with the egg wash.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 10 minutes then reduce the heat to 350 F. Continue to bake
        until the puffs are golden and cooked through, another 24 to 27 minutes
        approximately. Remove from the oven and let them cool completely on the
        baking trays or a wire rack.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Fill and Serve</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Once the pastries are completely cool, use a paring knife or a chopstick
        to poke a hole at the bottom of each.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pastry cream from the fridge and transfer it into the bowl of
        a stand mixer fitted with the paddle. Mix the pastry cream on medium
        speed until smooth and silky, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fit a piping bag with a 1/3 inch round tip and fill the piping bag with
        the pastry cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gather the prepared piping bag filled with pastry cream and pipe enough
        cream in each puff until it feels heavy and it starts to overflow
        slightly. Scrape off any excess cream from the bottom of the pastry and
        transfer to a serving platter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sift the confectioners' sugar over the tops of the cream puffs and serve
        immediately.
      </li>
    </ol>
