    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 cups (228 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>3 large very ripe bananas</li>
      <li>1/4 cup oil</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 F. Thoroughly grease a 9-inch loaf pan.</li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, nuts, baking powder, baking
        soda, salt, and cinnamon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel the bananas and mash them in a separate mixing bowl using a potato
        masher or a fork.
      </li>
      <li>Stir the oil into the mashed bananas and mix until well blended.</li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, beat the eggs. Add the sugar and beat until
        dissolved.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the vanilla, then add the egg mixture to the banana mixture and
        stir until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix gently until
        there are no more pockets of dry flour. It's okay if the batter is
        visibly lumpy. It is extremely important not to overmix the batter, or
        the resulting bread will be tough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the liquid and dry ingredients have been combined, gently pour the
        batter into your prepared loaf pan and transfer to the oven immediately.
        Bake 50 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the
        loaf comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>Remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        To remove the bread, carefully invert the panâ€”the loaf should drop right
        out, so make sure you support it with your other hand. Let the loaf cool
        on a wire rack at room temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The key to good quick bread is not overmixing the batter. Once the
        liquid ingredients are added to the dry, mix the batter by hand just
        until the flour is moistened, which should only take about 10 seconds.
        Too much mixing can cause the final product to be dry, tough, or
        misshapen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the nuts with the dry ingredients instead of folding them into
        the batter right before baking. This ensures that they will not sink to
        the bottom of the loaf. This trick works with blueberries, chocolate
        chips, or any other add-ins.
